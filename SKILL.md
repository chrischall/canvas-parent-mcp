# canvas-parent-mcp

MCP server for Canvas LMS (Instructure) — read courses, grades, assignments, announcements, planner items, and conversations; download course files. Mirrors the parent/observer scope of the sibling `infinitecampus-mcp`.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/canvas-parent-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-parent-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/canvas-parent-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/canvas-parent-mcp)

## Setup

### Option A — npx (recommended)

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "canvas-parent-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CANVAS_BASE_URL": "https://cms.instructure.com",
        "CANVAS_USERNAME": "me@example.com",
        "CANVAS_PASSWORD": "your-canvas-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B — from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrischall/canvas-parent-mcp
cd canvas-parent-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

## Authentication

**Username/password (recommended).** Set `CANVAS_USERNAME` + `CANVAS_PASSWORD`. The server logs in lazily on the first request and silently re-mints session cookies on 401 — no manual rotation. Direct Canvas accounts only — no SAML/Google/Microsoft SSO or 2FA.

### Advanced alternatives

- **Personal access token** — set `CANVAS_TOKEN`. Generate via Canvas → Account → Settings → "+ New Access Token". Most institutions have disabled this for non-admins.
- **OAuth** — set `CANVAS_CLIENT_ID`, `CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CANVAS_REFRESH_TOKEN`. Useful when SSO blocks the username/password flow; bootstrap with `canvas-parent-mcp-qr-login` from a Canvas web QR.

Precedence when multiple are set: `CANVAS_TOKEN` > `CANVAS_USERNAME`+`CANVAS_PASSWORD` > OAuth.

## Notes

- Set `CANVAS_NAME` if you want a friendly label other than the host portion of the base URL.
- All read tools that target a user accept an optional `observeeId` parameter (defaults to `self`) — useful when an observer is checking on a linked student.
